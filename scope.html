                <h1>Scope</h1>
                <p>Project B-READI stands for Building Reliable Effective and Aware DIsaster emergency and prevention managing skills.</p>
                <p>National and Local Governments, Communities as well as public and private companies need to create an in-depth emergency plan not only for managing the immediate consequences of a disaster but also and mainly for ensuring a community recovers and thrives. This requires establishing a network of interconnected and interdisciplinary capacities and skills prior to a disaster, providing a quick response to the event and managing the recovery process. The reliability and effectiveness of such a network depend on sound and aware coordination. In the last years, due to the increasing crises, the profile of an Emergency Manager has been developed, and some kinds of certifications are proposed at a national and international level, but not connected with a university curriculum. Often holders of such Certifications get their start by working as police officers, detectives, firefighters, safety technicians, police dispatchers, paramedics, and others who gained substantial experience in emergency situations.</p>
                <p>While an extensive work experience is a fundamental requirement for an Emergency Manager, the actual economic, social and environmental scenario demands a strong mix of deep knowledge and skills as solid communication, critical thinking, decision-making, interpersonal, and leadership that can be developed only within Master degrees related to law enforcement, public administration, business administration, Engineering and Medicine.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, since disasters can take several different forms, national and local governments and organisations must be ready for tackling any emergency that may incur, that is, they must be aware of all possible risks, be able to imagine the worst-case scenario and have the capacity to work out a plan for how to deal with it. This means that it is necessary to develop further competencies and skills to provide the existing EM profiles with enhanced and additional knowledge, capacities and skills.</p>
                <p>In these tragic days when Corona-virus started spreading around the world, and timely actions were fundamental, two main points have been obvious:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li> in each country, the government adopts its policy without coordination with the others, and,</li>
                    <li> each National Service for Civil Protection uses different approaches, methods and tools preventing a common strategy, even when the national boundaries are not an obstacle for the danger's spreading.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For these reasons many experts have claimed the need to create the profile of a European Professional for the crisis management. Furthermore, the volunteers have been proved to be the backbone of the substantial assistance to the population from any field.</p>
                <p>The project intends to contribute to tackling the problems as mentioned earlier by achieving two main objectives:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li> designing multi-disciplinary curricula for the establishment of two professional profiles with European value: 1) European Crisis Emergency Manager (ECEM) and 2) European Prevention Manager (EPM), and</li>
                    <li> providing teachers with competencies and skills for designing and implementing a multi-disciplinary modular curriculum offering a high degree of flexibility in the study plan establishment.</li>
                </ul>
